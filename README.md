üìù Dynamic Quote Generator
--

In this project, I built a Dynamic Quote Generator web application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript with advanced DOM manipulation techniques.

The goal of the project was to learn how to create, modify, and manage elements in the DOM without using frameworks, while also exploring web storage, JSON handling, and even server synchronization.

üéØ Project Objectives
_________________________________________________________________________________
Practice core JavaScript DOM manipulation.

Build a fully interactive application with user input.

Learn to use Local Storage and Session Storage to persist data.

Handle JSON import/export for data sharing.

Implement a filtering system for dynamic content.

Simulate server syncing and manage conflict resolution.

üìå What I Implemented

Dynamic Quote Display

A system to show random quotes by category.

Quotes are displayed dynamically on button clicks.

Add New Quotes & Categories

Users can add new quotes through a form.

If a new category is introduced, it updates instantly.

Web Storage Integration

Quotes are saved in Local Storage so they persist across sessions.

The last viewed quote is saved in Session Storage for the current tab.

JSON Import & Export

Users can export quotes to a .json file.

Users can import quotes from JSON, merging them into their collection.

Category Filtering System

A dropdown menu filters quotes by category.

The last selected filter is remembered using Local Storage.

Server Sync (Simulation)

Used a mock API to simulate syncing quotes with a server.

Implemented conflict resolution: server data takes precedence.

Added auto-sync every 60 seconds with status updates.

Sharing Feature

A Tweet button allows sharing quotes directly to Twitter.

üöÄ Skills Demonstrated
_________________________________________________________________________________

JavaScript DOM manipulation (creating, updating, deleting elements).

Event handling for dynamic interactions.

Local & Session Storage for data persistence.

JSON parsing and stringifying for import/export.

Conflict resolution strategies in syncing data.

Problem-solving & debugging while managing interactive UI states.

üìñ Summary
______________________________________________________________________________

In this project, I created a full-featured interactive web app that not only displays quotes but also allows users to manage their own collection.

I started from a basic DOM manipulation exercise and expanded it step by step into a more realistic application that covers:

User interaction,

Data persistence,

Content filtering,

JSON handling, and

Simulated server communication.

This project strengthened my understanding of core JavaScript and gave me practical experience in building dynamic, user-driven web applications.
